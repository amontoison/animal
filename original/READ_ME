ANIMAL BREEDING DATA FOR LARGE LEAST SQUARES PROBLEM

Some large rectangular matrices used in animal breeding are
presented.
We describe how to generate in Harwell-Boeing format these 
matrices from the data supplied by animal breeders. The 
matrices are very sparse (3 nonzeros per row) and range 
between 26x20 and 968652x582694.

Several extremely sparse matrices were used to estimate the
breeding values for pigs in Switzerland. In the original
scheme the animal breeders usually solve the normal equations
using SOR or Cholesky factorization.
The matrices are rank deficient with rank deficiency of 1.
To compute the solution they set the last component of the
solution to 0.

The following files are available:

descr.ps.Z: compressed file containing the CERFACS report
            describing the animal data;
Conv.tar.Z: compressed directory containing the files
	    conv.f, conv2.f : conversion programs to generate
			      the matrices in Harwell-Boeing 
                              format.
            The code conv.f constructs problems where only the
            single trait "weight increase" is considered. The
            code conv2.f deals with both traits. The matrices
            constructed using conv.f are smaller than those 
            constructed using conv2.f. 
Small.tar.Z: compressed directory containing the data files
	     x.data, x.ped 
	     s.data, s.ped
	     m.data, m.ped
	     to describe the small problems;
Large.tar.Z: compressed directory containing the data files
	     l.data, l.ped 
	     to describe the large problem;
Very.tar.Z: compressed directory containing the data files
	    v.data, v.ped 
	    to describe the very large problem;
Extreme.tar.Z: compressed directory containing the data files
	       e.data, e.ped 
	       to describe the extreme problem.
